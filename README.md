# The Worst Meeting EVER
#### a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure game by Marty Taylor
#### originally made for Ludum Dare 27

## _Who seconded first?_
That's the goal of this game: to figure out who was the first second on a proposal to abolish local taxes. You, a faithful citizen, must figure out who is to go down in the history books as a local hero.

## Why was this made?
[Ludum Dare](ludumdare.com) is a 48-to-72-hour game programming competition where the games made fit a theme. Ludum Dare 27 has held August 23rd-26th 2013, and the theme was __Ten Seconds__. The entries can be found [here](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-27/), and this was one of them. The original post can be found [here](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-27/?action=preview&uid=17283). I was rated 43rd out of 1436 in terms of humor, so that's pretty cool.
